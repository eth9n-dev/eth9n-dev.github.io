# **Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering**

For this enhancement, I used my CS360 (Mobile Application Development) project that could track and modify inventory items. The enhancement consists of translating the Java code used in Android Studio to Python and creating a Desktop GUI that allows the user to track inventory. The Desktop GUI was created using the PyQT framework and other database enhancements were made to increase account security.

# **Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures**

For this enhancement, I forked an open-source simple calculator from GitHub that was written in JavaScript. The original calculator used built-in JavaScript functions to perform arithmetic. To enhance this project, I used an expression evaluation algorithm similar to Dijkstra's Shunting Yard algorithm. On top of that, I added parentheses functionality as well as exponents.

# **Enhancement Three: Databases**

For this enhancement, I used my CS340 (Advanced Programming Concepts) project that was a Jupyter notebook/Dash web application that used a database of animals and displayed information on them. To enhance this artifact, I translated it to a Desktop application using the Tkinter Python library. The enhancement is a MongoDB interface that interacts with a data set of 20,000+ movies and displays information such as actors and plot in a clean way.
